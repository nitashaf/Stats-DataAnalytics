I am ok by this since assisting our higher ed system is a sound watershed group pursuit.  I believe however that MSU could do more to connect with watershed groups.  Say, if MSU could offer technical speakers for watershed group meetings.  It may increase MSU positive visibility.  Carbon County and others in the State are higher education deserts and without higher ed outreach, it could remain that way.   Maybe start by sending watershed groups a roster of technical speakers willing to Zoom or travel, and we would very gladly consider them for our educational meetings.  As it is, watershed groups really have no table of contents to the MSU technical encyclopedia.   

The positive point is that it appears both sides of this survey need data, and I am sure we can jointly work to improve the exchange.  Very best to you and thanks for the opportunity to provide both data and opinion.  ",2,3,4,2,1,6,6,7,7,6
