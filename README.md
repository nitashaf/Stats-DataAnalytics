# Stats-DataAnalytics
This repository contains some of the projects and assignments that I have completed, either individually or as part of a group. The details are as follows:

**Qualtrics Analysis**: Automated graph generation and data visualization processes for the annual report of the MSU Extension Water Quality Project

**STAT512 Final Report**: Analysis of the data collected from research "Over-Reporting in Handwashing Self-Reports: Potential Explanatory Factors and
Alternative Measurements"

**Data Analysis 1**: This dataset, sourced from Wetlaufer, Hendrikx, and Marshall (2016), examines the relationship between snow characteristics (snow density in kg/m³ or snow depth in mm) and various predictor variables. The focus of the analysis is on snow presence or absence at each sampling location (SnowPresence). To measure snow characteristics, the dataset includes key environmental predictors:
elev: Elevation (in meters)
Land: Forest cover, where 0 = unforested and 10 = forested
rad: Potential Solar Radiation (in Wh/m²)
curvature: Describes the curvature of the terrain (detailed explanation here)
aspect: Orientation of the slope (in degrees, ranging from 0 to 360)
angle: Angle of slope (in degrees, with 0 representing a flat surface)
Additionally, the dataset takes into account the strata variable, which played a significant role in the data collection process, helping to ensure the sample’s representativeness. These fixed effect predictors are used to assess their influence on snow presence.

**Data Analysis 2**
